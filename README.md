# Covid_Bed_Management_System (IN PROGRESS)

This repository contains the Covid Bed Management System project, which is a database systems project focusing on creating a MySQL database and building different database tables for regular users, admins, and hospitals. The project utilizes a Bootstrap template that fits the aim of the project and acts as a UI that interacts with the database. Many customizations have been made to enhance the interactivity between the frontend template and the database.

## Project Overview

The Covid Bed Management System is developed using the Flask framework and utilizes popular Flask libraries such as Flask-SQLAlchemy and Flask_Hashpassword.

## Technologies Used

- Flask: Python-based web framework for building web applications.
- Flask-SQLAlchemy: Flask extension for working with Python SQLAlchemy library.
- Flask_Hashpassword: Flask extension for hashing passwords securely.
- Bootstrap: The frontend template was borrowed from bootstrap and later customized.
- MySQL: Relational database management system.
